Hello PLAYER
>>You fall from the sky and you land hard onto a pile of bones
You look around and you are enclosed by stone walls. Ahead of you are three ominous doors.

Your only way out is to go through a door... BUT which one...? (PICK WISELY) (1/2/3)
2

>>You gently push open the musty door...
>>Ahead of you are three challices on an IKEA table.
A key is in the first one whereas the other two are empty.
As you reach for it, they start shuffling right before your eyes 0_0.

The first cup is now in position 3.
The second cup is now in position 1.
The third cup is now in position 2.

Is it just me, or is Challice 2 glowing with a profuse, key-like light???
>>Where is the key doe?? (1/2/3)
1
Try harder.
>>Where is the key doe?? (1/2/3)
2
You picked up the glowing cup. It's a trap! You're so gullible.
>>Where is the key doe?? (1/2/3)
3
You got the key!

Congrats, which door will you unlock with your shiny new key?
Your only way out is to go through a door... BUT which one...? (PICK WISELY) (1/2/3)

>>You place the strange key into the equally strange lock on door III, and twist. It opens!

>>You walk into a rather beautiful room with adhesive glow-in-the-dark stars on the ceiling
Here are a bunch of wacky numbers:[0][1][2][3][4]
Which of these numbers represent the number of stars in the constellation above?

>>good

Well, now that you've guessed your way past this question...
Your only way out is to go through a door... BUT which one...? (PICK WISELY) (1/2/3)
3
Thinking about the BIG DIPPER constellation, and all the confidence you attained, you can now kick this door open.

>>Congrats, here's a math equation yay
 4*(3*5^2/15) - 3*(11-2^3) 
Figure out the answer.

Nicely done, you can continue on this harrowing journey.

You're almost there! You can almost smell the sunshine on just the other side of these three doors!
Your only way out is to go through a door... BUT which one...? (PICK WISELY) (1/2/3)

You got the right door! YOU MADE IT OUT!!
Congratulations on being so lucky to guess your way out of here

<h3>Explanation of what was done</h3>
<p> The user uses a command line argument like such: <code><pre>
./game.exe name </code></pre> This informs the program of what to address the player throughtout the game. In delivering the story print statements are used and conditional statements determine the outcome of this story that is decision based. The C coding language with its makefiles are utilized with the entire program and flashy title pages that are colored also use print and functions.Below is a preview of these that popup in the game. </p>
