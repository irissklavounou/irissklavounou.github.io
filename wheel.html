									<h1>CODING PROJECT: Wheel of fortune GAME</h1>
									</header>
								<h3>Project requirements:</h4>

<ul>	
<li>Allow a user to enter their own puzzle
<li>Have a used letter board
<li>Have a wheel that provides a random dollar amount from $500 to $5000.
<li>Allow 3 players to play and take turns
<li>Keep track of the 3 players' scores
<li>Player 1 will start the game. He/she will spin the wheel.
<li>Player 1 will call a letter and if there is a letter, fill in the blanks, add the letter in the used letter board, and give player 1 the money they landed on times the number of letters in the game. If the letter is not in puzzle, the next player will play.
<li>For simplicity, all letters can earn money (unlike in the real show, where a vowel costs $250).
<li>Write an AI (computer player) that plays relatively intelligently.
<li>Include a bankrupt space and a lose a turn space on the wheel.
<li>Allow a user to solve the puzzle at any time.
<li>Allow a user to buy a vowel for $250 and restrict a user from calling a vowel if he/she decided to spin the wheel.</li></ul>
