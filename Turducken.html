								<p>A set of heated skewers is to be designed to speed up
the cooking of a turducken, a turkey stuffed with a mixture of
chicken and duck, followed by stuffing. The design goal is to
reduce the amount of cooking time, while minimizing the amount
of the turducken that is burnt. This will be achieved through a
transient thermal analysis of the system using a combination of
manual calculations and Computer Aided Engineering (CAE)
software.</p>
							<p> The composition of the food properties are used to proportionally
find thermal properties that are necessary for transient thermal
analysis. The composition changes at different temperatures,
which is why the values are calculated at 42F, 165F, 212F, and
280F to include within a tabulated data for thermal simulations.
To calculate the thermal properties of each component, all
equations were provided as a function of temperature as stated in
the ASHRAE handbook.
All equations for the various thermal properties are given between
the temperature range of -40 to 300F.
</p>

<p>A simple heat transfer model is used to approximate the time
required to fully cook the turkey for different oven temperatures
and different heat fluxes injected by the two skewers. The system
is modeled as three concentric spheres of turkey, ducken and
stuffing with diameters 12.2in, 8in and 5.9in, respectively
(corresponding to the dimensions in Figure 1) .The system is
modeled as an electric circuit by making temperature T analogous
with voltage V, and heat flow q analogous with current i. Transfer
of heat through the system is thus modeled as charge flowing
through an electric circuit of resistors and capacitors representing
their thermal counterparts. The conductance, density and
capacitance of each food component is assumed to be constant in
this model, with its magnitude equal to the average from T=42F to
T=212F:</p>

<p>However, a limitation of this simulation is that it conglomerates
the heat capacitance of each food component to a single heat
capacitance, ignoring local heating behavior. This means that the
material adjacent to the rods and the surface of the turkey would
likely burn much earlier than predicted in this model. Therefore,
while hand calculated models predict increasing the oven to its
maximum temperature of 525F, and having a high qin is ideal to
heat the turducken quickly, this is not the best practice in reality.
Additionally, the thermal properties of materials change
drastically at 212F when water evaporates. By averaging the
resistance capacitance and densities, the model neglects such
effects. Nonetheless, the circuit model gives a good approximation
of magnitude, and a starting point for simulations.
</p>

	<p>To perform the meshing of the turducken, the various components
were isolated and meshed separately. As the turducken is
symmetrical, the thermal behavior will follow the symmetry. By
only analyzing half of the turducken, the number of nodes is
halved, thus reducing simulation time. To reject any loads at
exposed interior, adiabatic conditions will be used across the cut
surface. Additionally, splitting the circular holes and spherical
bodies down the middle ensures the mesh at theses areas of
interest generate properly.
