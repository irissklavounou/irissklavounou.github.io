								<p>After some prior arts research on sports wheels in the industry, I decided to choose a complicated concave design. This project involved the creation of a complex wheel design and its components in SolidWorks, utilizing a range of advanced features and techniques. Some of these consist of the use of intricate sketches to produce cross sections for the revolve function, as well as the revolving of dome-like structures in order to extrude objects centripetally. Reference planes were created to sketch surfaces at angles and extrude cut surfaces, while circular patterns were utilized for mirroring functions, which allows for a wide variety of applications in design. Threading holes for bolts was accomplished and text was added using SolidWorks' text function, with extruded cutting to produce an embedded, etched look. The design was further enhanced with the use of decals, textures, and colors. The bolts were created with chamfered ends and smoothed tops, while a helix spiral function was used to cut a sweep for ridges along with a triangle at the base. A motion study was conducted, which included exploding, collapsing, and inserting keys. Ultimately, this project showcased the extensive capabilities of SolidWorks and its ability to create intricate and sophisticated designs.</p>
