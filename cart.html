								<p> Alongside the <a href="waterturbine.html">Renewable Energy Project</a> was taking place, we were also given 6 weeks to iterate and finally test the car on the great height of Cooper Union's staircase. The rules were that the car was to weigh not more than a pound, have a flat front for the velcro, and have a component that is made of sheet metal. All of the components are to be made in-house, and to be a successful run, the cart must remain on the tracks the entire way until the launching of the pellet that was to land in the region calculated from the range calculation in our papers.</p>

							<p> For the manufacturing of the car, the body was an aluminum block that was cut to the desired shape with a CNC machine,the wheel axles were rods that were cut with a hand grinder, and finally the wheel was a project in itself: the car rims and wheel cast die were made from PLA 3-D prints, whereas the tire was silicone that was poured and treated into the  cast die prints. These are shown in the above pictures. The silicone mixture and technique arose from a conversation with a ME Senior, Jeanette Circe, who was working on materials that would work and survive in space.
